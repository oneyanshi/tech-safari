# Data Collection & Visualization
This repository contains the front-end and back-end portion of a four-person project completed over the course of a week during Tech Safari. There are two parts to the project. 

### 1. Collecting Environmental Data & Tracking Our Own Tracks 
Code related to this portion of the project is written using Adruino. James Deromedi built and designed a device that would collect data regarding the environment around us prior to the start of the trip. More information regarding this portion of the project can be found on a different repository on Bitbucket. The rationale for collecting this data is that San Francisco and the surrounding area act as 'micro-climates,' due to the hills, mountains, and the bay nearby. This information would be collected during Tech Safari. The data is pushed into a text file which can then later be accessed. Additionally, James also created a device that is connected to a satellite so we could collect information regarding our location. 

Data is set to be collected every five minutes. Environmental information that is collected is regarding humidity, air pressure, 

### 2. Documenting Our Time in the Bay Area & Silicon Valley 
This means that we all needed to be diligent about documenting our time. Pictures and videos were taken, which could later on be used in the visualization portion of our project. 

### 3. Visualizing the Data  
But what to do with all this data? You visualize it, of course -- a narrative can be found when data is visualized, so we were interested in seeing what we found. The data that is collected per day would then be cleaned and pushed into a CSV file. Our system relies solely on a webpage and a flat file database. Setting up a database for this project would be unnecessary as the amount of data we have is very little. Over the course of a week, we would have collected 400 points of data, each point having a collection of coordinates and environmental data associated with it.
